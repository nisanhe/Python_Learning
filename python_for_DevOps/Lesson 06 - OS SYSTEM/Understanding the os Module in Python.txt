1) os.getcwd(): Gets the current working directory.
2) os.chdir(path): Changes the current working directory to the specified path.
3) os.listdir(path): Returns a list of files and directories in the specified path.   
4) os.mkdir(path): Creates a new directory at the specified path.
5) os.makedirs(path): Creates directories recursively.   
6) os.rmdir(path): Removes an empty directory.
7) os.removedirs(path): Removes directories recursively.
8) os.rename(src, dst): Renames a file or directory.
9) os.remove(path): Removes a file.
10) os.path.exists(path): Checks if a path exists.
11) os.path.isfile(path): Checks if a path is a file.
12) os.path.isdir(path): Checks if a path is a directory.
13) os.path.join(path1, path2, ...): Joins paths securely, handling platform-specific separators.

Environment Variables:
